```

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter-stack-graphs-spicy/*/) for more details on how to use this library.

## Command-line Program

The command-line program for `tree-sitter-stack-graphs-spicy` lets you do stack graph based analysis and lookup from the command line.

Install the program using `cargo install` as follows:

```sh
$ cargo install --features cli tree-sitter-stack-graphs-spicy
$ tree-sitter-stack-graphs-spicy --help
```

## Development

The project is written in Rust, and requires a recent version installed. Rust can be installed and updated using [rustup][].

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

The project is organized as follows:

- The stack graph rules are defined in `src/stack-graphs.tsg`.
- Builtins sources and configuration are defined in `src/builtins.spicy` and `builtins.cfg` respectively.
- Tests are put into the `test` directory.

### Building and Running Tests

Build the project by running:

```sh
$ cargo build
```

Run the tests as follows:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

The project consists of a library and a CLI. By default, running `cargo` only applies to the library. To run `cargo` commands on the CLI as well, add `--features cli` or `--all-features`.

Run the CLI from source as follows:

```sh
$ cargo run --features cli -- ARGS
```

Sources are formatted using the standard Rust formatted, which is applied by running:

```sh
$ cargo fmt
```

### Writing TSG

The stack graph rules are written in [tree-sitter-graph][]. Checkout the [examples][],
which contain self-contained TSG rules for specific language features. A VSCode
[extension][] is available that provides syntax highlighting for TSG files.

[extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tree-sitter.tree-sitter-graph

Parse and test a single file by executing the following commands:

```sh
$ cargo run --features cli -- parse FILES...
$ cargo run --features cli -- test TESTFILES...
```

Generate a visualization to debug failing tests by passing the `-V` flag:

```sh
$ cargo run --features cli -- test -V TESTFILES...
```

To generate the visualization regardless of test outcome, execute:

```sh
$ cargo run --features cli -- test -V --output-mode=always TESTFILES...
```
